Hello!

This repository is created for the technical task.

**1. Develop a Python script to measure voltage (you can use Raspberry or Arduino as a measuring device and communicate via COM port): 
a. Input range 0..3.3V 
b. NPLC: 1, 5, 10**

Created a script for a PC that can read the data from arduino(File **voltage_pc.py**)
For arduino, I wrote a code in micropython (File **arduino.py**)

**2. Find the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for the data set (MS Excel can be used): 
364, 373, 358, 394, 378, 379, 357, 364, 350, 363, 392, 368, 359, 375, 399, 365, 379, 357, 380**

Using standard MS Excel functions from the set, determine the specified parameters.(File **task2excel.xlsx**)
In addition, I added an option to search for these parameters using standard python libraries.(File **task2python.py**)
